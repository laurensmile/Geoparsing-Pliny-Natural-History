Nor has fortune 's grandeur made any change in you save in enabling you to bestow all the benefit you desire . Consequently as all those methods of paying you reverence are open to everybody else , to me is left only the presumption of treating you with more intimate respect . For that presumption therefore you will debit the responsibility to yourself , and will grant yourself pardon on the score of my offence . I have tried to put on a bold face , and yet have not succeeded , as your grandeur meets me by another route and the rods of office that your genius bears make me move on yet further : in no other person ever radiate more genuinely the dictatorial power of oratory and the tribunician authority of wit !

SOL My own presumption has indeed gone further , in dedicating to you the present volumes — a work of a lighter nature , as it does not admit of talent , of which in any case I possessed only quite a moderate amount , nor does it allow of digressions , nor of speeches or dialogues , nor marvellous accidents or unusual occurrences — matters interesting to relate or entertaining to read . My subject is a barren one — the world of nature , or in other words life ; and that subject in its least elevated department , and employing either rustic terms or foreign , nay barbarian , words that actually have to be introduced with an apology . Moreover , the path is not a beaten highway of authorship , nor one in which the mind is eager to range : there is not one person to be found among us who has made the same venture , nor yet one among the Greeks who has tackled single-handed all departments of the subject .

And so as not to seem a downright adversary of the Greeks , I should like to be accepted on the lines of those founders of painting and sculpture who , as you will find in these volumes , used to inscribe their finished works , even the masterpieces which we can never be tired of admiring , with a provisional title such as Worked on by Apelles or Polyclitus , as though art was always a thing in process and not completed , so that when faced by the vagaries of criticism the artist might have left him a line of retreat to indulgence , by implying that he intended , if not interrupted , to correct any defect noted .

Varro makes a rather smaller claim in his Satires A Ulysses-and-a-half and Folding-tablet . Diodorus among the Greeks stopped playing with words and gave his history the title of Library . Indeed the philologist Apion ( the person whom Tiberius Caesar used to call ' the world 's cymbal ,' though he might rather have been thought to be a drum , advertising his own renown ) wrote that persons to whom he dedicated his compositions received from him the gift of immortality .

I am unable to refrain from quoting the actual words of Cato the Censor applying to this , to show that even the treatise on military discipline of Cato , who had learnt his soldiering under Africanus , or rather under him and Hannibal as well , and had been unable to endure even Africanus , who when commander-in-chief had won a triumph , found critics ready for it of the sort that try to get glory for themselves by running down another man 's knowledge .

You will deem it a proof of this pride of mine that I have prefaced these volumes with the names of my authorities . I have done so because it is , in my opinion , a pleasant thing and one that shows an honourable modesty , to own up to those who were the means of one 's achievements , not to do as most of the authors to whom I have referred did . For you must know that when collating authorities I have found that the most professedly reliable and modern writers have copied the old authors word for word , without acknowledgement , not in that valorous spirit of Virgil , for the purpose of rivalry , nor with the candour of Cicero who in his Republic declares himself a companion of Plato , and in his Consolation to his daughter says ' I follow Crantor ,' and similarly as to Panaetius in his De Officiis — volumes that you know to be worth having in one 's hands every day , nay even learning by heart . Surely it marks a mean spirit and an unfortunate disposition to prefer being detected in a theft to repaying a loan — especially as interest creates capital . SOL There is a marvellous neatness in the titles given to books among the Greeks . One they entitled Κηρίον , meaning Honeycomb ; others called their Kέρας Αμαλθείας , i.e. Horn of Plenty ( so that you can hope to find a draught of hen 's milk in the volume ) , and again Violets , Muses , Hold-alls , Handbooks , Meadow , Tablet , Impromptu titles that might tempt a man to forfeit his bail . But when you get inside them , good heavens , what a void you will find between the covers ! Our authors being more serious use the titles Antiquities , Instances and Systems , the wittiest , Talks by Lamplight , I suppose because the author was a toper — indeed Tippler was his name .
