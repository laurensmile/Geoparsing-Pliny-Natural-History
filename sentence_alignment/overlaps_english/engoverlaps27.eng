It is extracted , however , as soon as the seed begins to swell , the plant being soaked in water for three days when fresh and for seven when dried ; it is then boiled down to one third in a bronze vessel , ten heminae to forty-five sextarii of water ; and after being strained to remove the solid pieces it is boiled down again to the thickness of honey , just like juice obtained from the lesser centaury . But this juice is injurious to the stomach and head , while the decoction I mentioned is very wholesome . For it is astringent to the stomach , and with sil , Gallic nard and a little vinegar , brings away bile , promotes urine , soothes the bowels , curing them when in pain , drives out worms from the belly , and removes nausea and flatulence . With rue , pepper and salt , it takes away the distaste for food , and aids digestion , bringing away undigested food . As a purge , the old custom was to give six drachmae of the seed , three of salt , and a cyathus of honey , in a sextarius of sea water kept for a time , the purge being more efficacious if the amount of salt is doubled .

It will therefore be right for me , who have described no poisons , to point out the nature of aconite , if only for the purpose of detecting it .

The plant grows on bare crags which are called aconae , and for that reason some have given it the name of aconite , there being nothing near , not even dust , to give it nourishment . This then is the reason for its name given by some ; others have thought it was so named because it had the same power to cause rapid death as whetstones had to give an edge to an iron blade ; no sooner was the stone applied than its rapid action was noticeable .

To think that the Scythian plant , for example , is brought from the marshes of Maeotis , euphorbea from Mount Atlas and from beyond the pillars of Hercules , where the works of Nature actually begin to fail ; on another side britannica , from islands in the ocean lying beyond the mainland , aethiopis too from the clime scorched by the constellations of heaven , and other plants moreover passing hither and thither from all quarters throughout the whole world for the welfare of mankind , all owing to the boundless grandeur of the Roman Peace , which displays in turn not men only with their different lands and tribes , but also mountains , and peaks soaring into the clouds , their offspring and also their plants . May this gift of the gods last , I pray , for ever ! So truly do they seem to have given to the human race the Romans as it were a second Sun .

With rue , pepper and salt , it takes away the distaste for food , and aids digestion , bringing away undigested food . As a purge , the old custom was to give six drachmae of the seed , three of salt , and a cyathus of honey , in a sextarius of sea water kept for a time , the purge being more efficacious if the amount of salt is doubled . The pounding however must be carefully done , as it is a difficult task . Some have also given the aforesaid weight in pearl barley with the addition of pennyroyal ; some the leaves in a dried fig to children , so that the bitter taste is not noticed . Taken with iris it purges the thorax . For jaundice it is taken raw in drink with celery or adiantum . For flatulence it is slowly sipped hot in water ; for the liver it is taken with Gallic nard ; for the spleen , with vinegar , pottage or fig. In vinegar it is an antidote to poisonous fungi , as also to mistletoe ; in wine , to hemlock , the poison of the shrew mouse , sea weever and scorpions . It is a great aid to clear vision .

This Chance therefore , this is that great deity who has made most of the discoveries that enrich our life , this is the name of him by whom is meant she who is at once the Mother and the Mistress of all creation . Either guess is equally likely , whether we judge that wild animals make these discoveries every day or that they possess a never-failing instinct . Again it is shameful that all animals except man know what is health-giving for themselves . Our ancestors however advertised the view that aconite is also a very health-giving ingredient of preparations for the eyes , openly declaring their belief that no evil a at all is without some admixture of good .
If anyone believes that these discoveries could , by any chance , have been made by a man , he shows himself ungrateful for the gods' gifts . They touch flesh with aconite , and kill panthers by a mere taste of it , otherwise panthers would overrun the regions where they are found .

An application of the root is said to be a wonderful healer of wounds , especially of sinews even when they have been severed . A decoction of the root also , taken with honey , is good for relaxed , weak , or cut sinews . SOL Phalangitis is called by some phalangion , by others leucanthemum , or , as I find in some copies , leucacantha . It has little branches , never fewer than two , which grow in opposite directions ; white flowers like the red lily in shape , a black , broad seed , of the shape of half a lentil , but much thinner , and a slender root of a grass-green colour . The leaves , flowers or seed of this plant are of help for the treatment of wounds inflicted by scorpions , poisonous spiders , and serpents ; they are also good for griping colic . SOL To describe phyteuma is in my opinion a waste of time , because it is used only for love-philtres . SOL Phyllon is the name given by the Greeks to a plant that grows on rocky heights . The female is more grass-green in colour than the male , with a slender stem and a small root . The seed is like the round seed of a poppy .

Taken in drink it relaxes the bowels , bringing away bile and phlegm . A moderate dose is an acetabulum in three heminae of hydromel . It is sprinkled over foods and relishes to loosen the bowels . SOL Periclymenon too is a plant which grows into a shrub , having after an interval two leaves which are whitish and soft . And at the top among the leaves is a seed which is hard , and difficult to pluck . The plant grows in cultivated fields and in hedges , climbing round supports of any kind . Its seed is dried in the shade , pounded , and worked up into lozenges . These , dissolved in three cyathi of white wine , are given for thirty days to cure splenic affections , the spleen being reduced either by blood in the urine or through the bowels , as is plain immediately from the tenth day .

Some Greeks call pteris , others blachnon , the kind from the sole root of which shoot out several other ferns exceeding even two cubits in length , with a not unpleasant smell . This is considered male . The other kind the Greeks call thelypteris , some nymphaea pteris . It has only one stem , and is not bushy , but shorter , softer and more compact than the other , and channelled with leaves at the root . The root of both kinds fattens pigs . In both kinds the leaves are pinnate on either side , whence the Greeks have named them pteris . The roots of both are long , slanting , and blackish , especially when they have lost moisture ; they should , however , be dried in the sun . Ferns grow everywhere , but especially in a cold soil .

It is extracted , however , as soon as the seed begins to swell , the plant being soaked in water for three days when fresh and for seven when dried ; it is then boiled down to one third in a bronze vessel , ten heminae to forty-five sextarii of water ; and after being strained to remove the solid pieces it is boiled down again to the thickness of honey , just like juice obtained from the lesser centaury . But this juice is injurious to the stomach and head , while the decoction I mentioned is very wholesome . For it is astringent to the stomach , and with sil , Gallic nard and a little vinegar , brings away bile , promotes urine , soothes the bowels , curing them when in pain , drives out worms from the belly , and removes nausea and flatulence . With rue , pepper and salt , it takes away the distaste for food , and aids digestion , bringing away undigested food .

SOL Among all plants nothing is more wonderful than lithospermum , called by some exonychon , by others ' Juppiter 's corn ,' and by others ' corn of Hercules . ' The plant is about five inches high , with leaves twice as big as those of rue , and ligneous little branches of the thickness of a rush . Near the leaves it grows as it were little beards , which are single , and on their tops little stones , white and round as pearls , as big as a chick-pea but as hard as a stone . Where they are attached to pedicels these jewels have little holes , in which is the seed . The plant grows indeed in Italy , but the most highly valued in Crete , and I have never seen anything among plants that filled me with greater wonder .

It is more like a freshwater sponge than a moss or vascular plant , being a hairy , dense , and porous mass . To my knowledge a man who , pruning a very high tree , fell and broke nearly all his bones , was treated with this plant . His entire body was enveloped in it ; whenever it dried it was sprinkled with its native water but rarely taken off , only in fact for renewals when the plant lost its strength . The patient recovered in an almost incredibly short time . SOL The Cnidian grain has the colour of kermes-red , and in size is larger than a peppercorn . Its heating properties are so great that it is swallowed in bread , lest it should scorch the throat in its passage . A sovereign remedy for hemlock poisoning , it also checks looseness of the bowels . SOL Dipsacos has leaves like those of lettuce , with prickly knobs on the middle of their backs .

This stem is reddish , with bark like that of bay ; the leaves resemble those of isatis , only more fleshy , rounder , and smaller . The seed is in pods , with some grains red , some black . There are however two kinds of the plant . The one to the roots of which are attached about six or eight rather long bulbs like acorns is regarded as female . The male has no more bulbs , since it is supported only by a single root , a span deep , white , and astringent to the taste .

About its use there is general agreement , for it is a plant very easily found , and one of the most useful , being moreover especially honoured at the religious rites of the Roman people , seeing that at the Latin festival there is a race for four-horse chariots on the Capitoline Hill , the winner of which takes a draught of wormwood , our ancestors thinking , I believe , that health was a very grand prize to give . It strengthens the stomach and for this reason it is used , as I have said , to give a flavour to wines . A decoction in water , which is afterwards cooled in the open for a day and a night , is also taken ; six drachmae of the leaves with their branches are boiled down in three sextarii of rain water ; salt too should be added . When very old it can still be used . There is also administered an infusion of wormwood in water ; for this preparation should be styled ' infusion ,' and an essential of the infusion is that , whatever quantity of water is used , for three days the preparation should be wholly enclosed . Pounded wormwood is rarely employed ; rarely too the extracted juice . It is extracted , however , as soon as the seed begins to swell , the plant being soaked in water for three days when fresh and for seven when dried ; it is then boiled down to one third in a bronze vessel , ten heminae to forty-five sextarii of water ; and after being strained to remove the solid pieces it is boiled down again to the thickness of honey , just like juice obtained from the lesser centaury .

SOL There is no doubt either that the potency and efficacy of all roots are lessened if the fruit ripens before they are dug , and it is the same with seeds if the root has been cut previously for the sake of the juice . The properties moreover of all plants are weakened by habit , and they cease to be beneficial when needed if they have been in daily use ; similarly with harmful plants . All plants however have greater efficacy and potency when they grow in cold regions subject to north-east winds , and likewise those that grow in dry . SOL There are also considerable differences between races . I have heard for instance about tapeworms and maw-worms , that they infest the peoples of Egypt , Arabia , Syria and Cilicia , while on the contrary they are never found at all among those of Thrace and Phrygia . This is less remarkable than their being found among the Thebans , but not among the Athenians , although Attica and Boeotia are adjoining territories .

The kind to be rejected is dark and hard , gritty , and adulterated with gum and acacia , the adulteration being easily detected by the taste . The nature of an aloe is bracing , astringent ! and gently warming . There are many uses for it , but the chief is to relax the bowels , for it is almost the only laxative that is also a stomach tonic , no ill effects whatever resulting from its use . A drachma is taken in drink , but for fluxes of the stomach a spoonful in two cyathi of warm or cold water is taken twice or three times a day at intervals , as circumstances require ; but for purging the bowels the maximum dose is three drachmae , which is more effective if food is taken after the draught . With a dry wine it prevents the hair from falling out , the head being thoroughly rubbed in the contrary way to the hair .

SOL Glaucion grows in Syria and Parthia , a low plant , with tightly packed leaves , rather like those of the poppy but smaller and dirtier looking ; it has a foul smell and a bitter , astringent taste . The seed , of a saffron colour , is put into a pot lined with fuller 's clay and heated in an oven . Then it is taken out , and a juice of the same name is extracted from it . Both the juice and beaten-up leaves are used for the fluxes that fall in streams from the whole eye . There is made from it a salve called by physicians diaglaucin . It also restores a rich supply of milk if this fails . When taken for this purpose , water is the medium . SOL Glycyside , called by some paeonia or pentorobon , has a stem two spans high ; two or three others go with it .

The plant grows on bare crags which are called aconae , and for that reason some have given it the name of aconite , there being nothing near , not even dust , to give it nourishment . This then is the reason for its name given by some ; others have thought it was so named because it had the same power to cause rapid death as whetstones had to give an edge to an iron blade ; no sooner was the stone applied than its rapid action was noticeable . SOL Aethiopis has leaves like those of phlomos , large , numerous and hairy , growing from the root . The stem is quadrangular , rough , like that of arction and hollowed by many axils .

It used also to be given by itself in doses of two cyathi , before the paroxysms of agues , especially tertian and quartan , also for cholera , dysentery and a relaxed stomach . The third kind , called orion , grows on mountains and is like a tender reed . It has one stem with knots close together and fitted one into another , leaves resembling those of the pitch pine , and a root of no medicinal use . This kind is less efficacious than those already mentioned , and used especially for sciatica . The fourth kind is called wild polygonum , a shrub that is almost a tree ; it has a ligneous root , a red trunk like that of the cedar , branches like those of spartum , two spans long , and with three or four dark , knotted joints . This kind too is of an astringent nature , and tastes like a quince . It is boiled down in water to one third , or dried and powdered for sprinkling on ulcerations of the mouth and excoriated bruises , but for sore gums the plant itself is chewed .

So charming the adornment that one might think that the jeweller 's art had arranged gleaming white pearls symmetrically among the leaves ; very exquisite and difficult the birth of a gem from a plant ! The authorities say that it lies and spreads over the ground ; have seen it only when gathered , not when so growing . It is indisputable that a drachma by weight of these jewels taken in white wine breaks up and brings away stone , and cures strangury . There is no other plant the medicinal property of which can be recognised with greater confidence ; its very appearance is such that at once by a glance , even without being told , people can become aware of this property .

This is less remarkable than their being found among the Thebans , but not among the Athenians , although Attica and Boeotia are adjoining territories . That thought brings me to the nature of animals themselves , and to the remedies for all diseases , of even greater reliability , that are implanted in them at birth . For again , the Mother of all creation both willed that no animal should be born merely to eat or to satisfy the appetites of others , implanting also healthful medicines in their vitals , because she was implanting them even in unconscious things , and she also willed that those outstanding aids to life should come from another life , a thought beyond all else most wonderful .
The properties moreover of all plants are weakened by habit , and they cease to be beneficial when needed if they have been in daily use ; similarly with harmful plants . All plants however have greater efficacy and potency when they grow in cold regions subject to north-east winds , and likewise those that grow in dry .

' SOL Limeum is the name given by the Gauls to a plant that they use to make a drug , called by them deer poison , with which when hunting they poison their arrows . As much of the plant as is usually used for one arrow is mixed with three bushels of saliva stimulant , and when cattle are sick this mash is forced down their throats . Afterwards they must be tied to their stalls until they are purged — for they usually go wild — and if sweating ensues cold water should be poured over them . SOL Leuce , a plant like mercurialis , has a reason for the name it bears , because a white line runs down the middle of the leaves , which is why some call it mesoleucion . Its juice heals fistulas ; crushed , the plant itself cures malignant ulcers . Perhaps it is the same as the plant called leueas , which is a remedy for the poison of all sea creatures .

To think that the Scythian plant , for example , is brought from the marshes of Maeotis , euphorbea from Mount Atlas and from beyond the pillars of Hercules , where the works of Nature actually begin to fail ; on another side britannica , from islands in the ocean lying beyond the mainland , aethiopis too from the clime scorched by the constellations of heaven , and other plants moreover passing hither and thither from all quarters throughout the whole world for the welfare of mankind , all owing to the boundless grandeur of the Roman Peace , which displays in turn not men only with their different lands and tribes , but also mountains , and peaks soaring into the clouds , their offspring and also their plants . May this gift of the gods last , I pray , for ever ! So truly do they seem to have given to the human race the Romans as it were a second Sun . SOL But who could revere enough the diligent research of the ancients ? It is established that of all poisons the quickest to act is aconite , and that death occurs on the same day if the genitals of a female creature are but touched by it . This was the poison that Marcus Caelius accused Calpurnius Bestia of using to kill his wives in their sleep . Hence the damning peroration of the prosecutor 's speech accusing the defendant 's finger . Fable has it that aconite sprang out of the foam of the dog Cerberus when Hercules dragged him from the underworld , and that this is why it grows around Heraclea in Pontus , where is pointed out the entrance to the underworld used by Hercules .

The seed is on the twigs , hanging dawn in clusters , and has a vinous smell ; and so the plant is called botrys by some , although others call it artemisia . The Cappadocians use it for chaplets .
When used as a purge it is pounded with the seed and taken early in the morning or after dinner , the dose being two drachmae in hydromel , wine , or plain water , and the whole draught a sextarius . It brings away bile , and is excellent for sciatica , but on the following day should be swallowed a drachma of caper root well mixed with resin . This dose should be repeated after an interval of four days . After the actual purging wine should be drunk by the stronger patients and water by the weaker .

The plant grows indeed in Italy , but the most highly valued in Crete , and I have never seen anything among plants that filled me with greater wonder .
