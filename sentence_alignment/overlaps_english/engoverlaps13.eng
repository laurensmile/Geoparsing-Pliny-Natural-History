Resin or gum are added to retain the scent in the solid part , as it evaporates and disappears very quickly if these are not added . SOL The unguent most quickly made and probably the first invented was made of bryon and behen-oil , of which we have spoken above . Later the Mendes scent came in , made of behen-oil , resin and myrrh , and at the present day metopium is even more popular ; this is an oil made in Egypt , pressed out of bitter almonds , with the addition of omphacium , cardamom , rush , reed , honey , wine , myrrh , seed of balsam , galbanum and terebinth-resin . One of the commonest unguents indeed — and at the present day it is consequently believed also to be one of the oldest — is one made of myrtle-oil , reed , cypress , cyprus , mastic-oil and pomegranate rind . But I am inclined to believe that the scents most widely used are those made from the rose , which grows in great abundance everywhere ; and so the simplest compound was for a long time that of oil of roses , though additional ingredients used are omphacium , rose and saffron blossoms , cinnabar , reed , honey , rush , flower of salt or else alkanet , and wine .

Also cheaper kinds of oil are compounded out of myrtle and laurel with the addition of marjoram , lilies , fenugreek , myrrh , casia , nard , rush and cinnamon .

They also differ in size , many having reached half a yard in length while some are no larger than a bean .
All over the Thebaid and Arabia the dates are dry and small , with a shrivelled body , and as they are scorched by the continual heat their covering is more truly a rind than a skin . Indeed in Ethiopia itself the climate is so dry that the skin of these dates is rubbed into powder and kneaded to make loaves of bread like flour . This date grows on a shrub , with branches eighteen inches long , a rather broad leaf , and fruit of a round shape , but larger than the size of an apple . The Greek name for this date is koix ; it comes to maturity in three years , and the shrub always has fruit on it. another date sprouting in place of one picked . The date of the Thebaid is packed into casks at once , before it has lost the aroma of its natural heat ; if this is not done , it quickly loses its freshness and dries up unless it is warmed up again in an oven .

The best kinds for keeping are those that grow in salt and sandy soils , for instance in Judea and the Cyrenaic district of Africa ; the dates in Egypt , Cyprus , Syria and Seleucia in Assyria do not keep , and consequently are used for fattening swine and other stock .

Some people make an incision in the stalk during harvest-time and make a hollow in the root itself for the juice to collect in , and when it has dried take it away ; others pound the leaves and stalk and root in a mortar and after drying the juice hard in the sun cut it up into lozenges . The emperor Nero at the beginning of his reign gave this juice a famous advertisement , as when during his nocturnal escapades his face had sustained a number of bruises he smeared it with a mixture of thapsia , frankincense and wax and on the following day gave the lie to rumour by going about with a whole skin . It is a well-known fact that fire can be best kept alight in a fennel stalk , and that the fennels in Egypt are the best . SOL In Egypt also grows the caper-tree , a shrub with a rather hard wood ; also its seed is well known as an article of food , and is usually gathered together with the stalk . Its foreign varieties should be avoided , inasmuch as the Arabian kind is poisonous and the African injures the gums , and that from Marmarica , is injurious to the womb . Also the Apulian caper-tree produces vomiting and diarrhoea by causing flatulence in all the organs .

Also a slip torn off from the root makes a hardy growth when planted , and so does one from the youngest of the branches . In Assyria the tree itself , too , is laid in a moist soil and throws out roots along its whole length , but these grow into shrubs and not into a tree ; consequently the growers plant cuttings , and transplant the young trees when a year old and again when two years old , for they like a change of position — this is done in the spring in other countries , but in Assyria about the rising of the Dog-star . Also there they do not touch the young trees with a knife , but tie back the leafy shoots to make them grow upward to a considerable height . When the trees are strong they prune them down so as to make them grow thicker , leaving the stumps of the branches six inches long ; to lop them at any other point kills the mother tree . We have said above that palms like a salt soil ; consequently in places where the ground is not of that nature they sprinkle salt on it , not at the roots of the trees but a little farther off .

In Assyria the tree itself , too , is laid in a moist soil and throws out roots along its whole length , but these grow into shrubs and not into a tree ; consequently the growers plant cuttings , and transplant the young trees when a year old and again when two years old , for they like a change of position — this is done in the spring in other countries , but in Assyria about the rising of the Dog-star . Also there they do not touch the young trees with a knife , but tie back the leafy shoots to make them grow upward to a considerable height . When the trees are strong they prune them down so as to make them grow thicker , leaving the stumps of the branches six inches long ; to lop them at any other point kills the mother tree . We have said above that palms like a salt soil ; consequently in places where the ground is not of that nature they sprinkle salt on it , not at the roots of the trees but a little farther off . Some palms in Syria and Egypt divide into two trunks , and in Crete even into three , and some even into five .

The material is an excrescence of the root , and is very greatly admired when it grows entirely underground , and so is more uncommon than the knobs that grow above ground , on the branches as well as on the trunk ; and the timber bought at so high a price is in reality a disease of the trees , the size and the roots of which can be judged from the circular tabletops . In foliage , scent and the appearance of the trunk these trees resemble the female cyprus , which is also a forest tree .
Also two hanging tables were sold at auction by King Juba , of which one fetched 1,200,000 sesterces and the other a little less . A table that was lately destroyed in a fire came down from the Cethegi and had changed hands at 1,300,000 sesterces — the price of a large estate , supposing somebody preferred to devote so large a sum to the purchase of landed property .

Still , if even these matters deserve to be graded after a fashion , we find in the works left by Marcus Cicero that unguents that have an earthy scent are more agreeable than those smelling of saffron , inasmuch as even in a class of things where corruption is most rife , nevertheless some degree of strictness in vice itself gives more enjoyment .

One of the commonest unguents indeed — and at the present day it is consequently believed also to be one of the oldest — is one made of myrtle-oil , reed , cypress , cyprus , mastic-oil and pomegranate rind .
Athens has persistently maintained the credit of her ' all-Athenian ' perfume . There was also once an unguent called panther-scent at Tarsus , even the recipe for compounding which has disappeared ; narcissus-scent has also ceased to be made from the narcissus flower . SOL The recipe for making unguents contains two ingredients , the juice and the solid part , the former which usually consists of various sorts of oil and the latter of scented substances , the oils being called ' astringents' and the scents ' sweetenings . ' Together with these there is a third factor that many people neglect — that of colour , for the sake of which cinnabar and alkanet should be added . A sprinkle of salt serves to preserve the properties of the oil , but to scents containing an admixture of alkanet salt is not added . Resin or gum are added to retain the scent in the solid part , as it evaporates and disappears very quickly if these are not added .

One of the commonest unguents indeed — and at the present day it is consequently believed also to be one of the oldest — is one made of myrtle-oil , reed , cypress , cyprus , mastic-oil and pomegranate rind . But I am inclined to believe that the scents most widely used are those made from the rose , which grows in great abundance everywhere ; and so the simplest compound was for a long time that of oil of roses , though additional ingredients used are omphacium , rose and saffron blossoms , cinnabar , reed , honey , rush , flower of salt or else alkanet , and wine .

First an upright layer is smeared on to the table , using the full length of papyrus available after the trimmings have been cut off at both ends , and afterwards cross strips complete the lattice-work . The next step is to press it in presses , and the sheets are dried in the sun and then joined together , the next strip used always diminishing in quality down to the worst of all . There are never more than twenty sheets to a roll . SOL There is a great difference in the breadth of the various kinds of paper : the best is thirteen inches wide , the hieratic two inches less , the Fannian measures ten inches and the amphitheatre paper one less , while the Saitic is still fewer inches across and is not as wide as the mallet used in making it , as the emporitic kind is so narrow that it does not exceed six inches . Other points looked at in paper are fineness , stoutness , whiteness and smoothness . The status of best quality was altered by the emperor Claudius .

He also recommends a potion made of cytisus dried and boiled in water to be given with wine to nursing women when their milk fails , and he says this will make the infants stronger and taller ; also he advises giving it while in the green state to fowls , or if it has dried , after being steeped . Moreover , Democritus and Aristomachus promise that bees will never fail if there is cytisus available for them to feed on . No other fodder is less expensive . It is sown when barley is , or in the spring , like leek , if the seed is used ; or else the stalk is planted in autumn before the winter solstice . If sown the seed is soaked , or , if there is a shortage of rain , it is watered after sowing . When the plants are 18 inches high they are replanted in a trench a foot deep .

Moreover — a fact that makes me very much surprised that it is rare in Italy — it is not afraid of damage from heat and cold and hail and snow , and , as Hyginus adds , not even from wood-grubs , as its wood has no attraction for them . SOL Shrubs and trees also grow at the bottom of the sea — those in the Mediterranean being of smaller size , for the Red Sea and the whole of the Eastern Ocean are filled with forests . The Latin language has no name for what the Greeks call phycos , as our word alga denotes a herbaceous sea-plant , whereas the phycos is a shrub . It has a broad leaf and is coloured green ; and it produces a growth one of the Greek names for which means ' leek-weed ' and the other ' bind-weed . ' Another variety of the same shrub has a hair-like leaf resembling fennel , and grows on rocks , while the one above grows in shallow water near the coast ; both kinds shoot in springtime and die off in autumn . The phycos growing on rocks round the island of Crete is also used for a purple dye ; the most approved kind being that growing on the northern side of the island , as is the case in regard to sponges .

The fruit contains a large stone , but the fleshy part , owing to its nature and to the abundance in which it grows , provides the natives with quite a harvest , as after cleaning it they crush it and make it into cakes for storage . There was also once a forest region round Memphis with such huge trees that three men could not join hands round The trunks ; and one of them was particularly remarkable , not because of its fruit or its utility for some purpose , but on account of the circumstance that it has the appearance of a thorn , but leaves resembling wings , which when somebody touches the branches at once fall off and afterwards sprout again . SOL It is agreed that the Egyptian thorn supplies the best kind of gum ; it is of a streaked appearance , grey in colour , clean and free from bark , and it sticks to the teeth ; its price is 3 denarii per pound .
It has sharp thorns even on the leaves , and seed in pods that is used instead of oak-galls in dressing leather . The blossom has a pleasing effect in garlands and also makes a valuable medicine ; also the tree distils gum . But its most valuable property is that when cut down it shoots up again two years later .

Next to this is the Saitic paper named from the town where it is produced in the greatest abundance , being made from shavings of inferior quality , and the Taeneotic , from a neighbouring place , made from material still nearer the outside skin , in the case of which we reach a variety that is sold by mere weight and not for its quality . As for what is called ' emporitic ' paper , it is no good for writing but serves to provide covers for documents and wrappers for merchandise , and consequently takes its name from the Greek word for a merchant . After this comes the actual papyrus , and its outermost layer , which resembles a rush and is of no use even for making ropes except those used in water .

There is an extremely prolific yield , but only if incisions are made in the fruit with iron hooks , otherwise it does not ripen ; but when this is done , it can be plucked three days later , another fig forming in its place , the tree thus scoring seven crops of extremely juicy figs in a summer .
Its wood is fairly flexible and remains sound to a great age ; it is of a shiny black colour . The flower grows in clusters like the olive , but is crimson in colour , and the foliage is thick . It also bears follicles out of which come insects resembling gnats , and which produce a sticky resinous fluid which also bursts out from its bark . SOL Also the male sumach-tree of Syria is productive , the female being barren ; the leaf is that of an elm only a little longer , covered with down , and the footstalks of the leaves always lying alternately in opposite directions ; the branches are slender and short . The sumach is used for bleaching leather . The seed , which resembles a lentil , turns red at the same time as the grapes ; it is called rhus and is required for certain drugs .

It is a well-known fact that Lucius Plotius , the brother of Lucius Plancus who was twice consul and censor , when proscribed by the Triumvirs was given away in his hiding-place at Salerno by the scent of the unguent he had been using — a disgrace that acquitted the entire proscription of guilt , for who would not consider that people of that sort deserved to die ?

Some people think that dung actually does it harm , while a section of the Assyrians think that this happens if they do not mix the dung with water from a stream . There are several kinds of palm , beginning with kinds not larger than a shrub — a shrub that in some cases is barren , though in other districts it too bears fruit — and having a short branch .

The reason was that the thin paper of the period of Augustus was not strong enough to stand the friction of the pen , and moreover as it let the writing show through there was a fear of a smudge being caused by what was written on the back , and the great transparency of the paper had an unattractive look in other respects . Consequently the foundation was made of leaves of second quality and the woof or cross layer of leaves of the first quality . Claudius also increased the width of the sheet , making it a foot across . There were also eighteen-inch sheets called ' maerocola ,' but examination detected a defect in them , as tearing off a single strip damaged several pages . On this account Claudius paper has come to be preferred to all other kinds , although the Augustus kind still holds the field for correspondence ; but Livia paper , having no quality of a first-class kind , but being entirely second class , has retained its position . SOL Roughness is smoothed out with a piece of ivory or a shell , but this makes the lettering apt to fade , as owing to the polish so given the paper does not take the ink so well , but has a shinier surface . The damping process if carelessly applied often causes difficulty in writing at first , and it can be detected by a blow with the mallet , or even by the musty smell if the process has been rather carelessly carried out . Spottiness also may be detected by the eye , but a bad porous strip found inserted in the middle of the pasted joins , owing to the sponginess of the papyrus , sucks up the ink and so can scarcely be detected except when the ink of a letter runs : so much opportunity is there for cheating .

It sends out shoots at the lower parts , and consequently is of a yellow colour above ground , as the suckers drain away the sap . If the fruit of the preceding year is picked about the rising of the Dog-star , it at once grows a second crop , after which it blossoms through the period of the Bear-ward , and the winter nourishes its fruit .
SOL A tree to some extent resembling the Egyptian fig is one in Crete called the Cyprian fig , as it also bears fruit on its actual trunk and on its branches when they have grown to thickness . But the Cyprian fig puts out a bud without any leaves , resembling a root . The trunk of the tree is like a poplar , and the leaf like an elm . It bears fruit four times a year , and also buds the same number of times , but its unripe figs will not ripen unless an incision is made in them to let out the juice . They have the sweet taste and the inside of the common fig , and are the size of a service-tree berry . SOL Another similar tree is the one called by the Ionians the ceronia , which also buds from the trunk , the fruit being a pod , which has consequently been called by some the Egyptian fig.

SOL There is also a shrub called cytisus , which has been remarkably praised by Amphilochus of Athens as a fodder for all kinds of cattle , and when dried for swine as well , and he guarantees a yearly return of 2,000 sesterces for an ingerum of it , even on only moderate soil . It serves the same purpose as vetch , but produces satiety more quickly , an animal being fattened by quite a moderate amount — so much so that beasts of burden fed on it refuse barley . No other fodder produces a larger quantity or a better quality of milk , and above everything as a medicine for cattle it renders them immune from all diseases . He also recommends a potion made of cytisus dried and boiled in water to be given with wine to nursing women when their milk fails , and he says this will make the infants stronger and taller ; also he advises giving it while in the green state to fowls , or if it has dried , after being steeped . Moreover , Democritus and Aristomachus promise that bees will never fail if there is cytisus available for them to feed on .

The wood has a rather uneven grain that is most attractive , and it is consequently very much admired by the Persians . SOL Also thorn-wood is equally esteemed in the same country , that is , the wood of a black thorn , as it lasts without decaying even in water , and is consequently extremely serviceable for the ribs of ships ; timbers made of a white thorn rot easily . It has sharp thorns even on the leaves , and seed in pods that is used instead of oak-galls in dressing leather . The blossom has a pleasing effect in garlands and also makes a valuable medicine ; also the tree distils gum . But its most valuable property is that when cut down it shoots up again two years later . This thorn grows in the neighbourhood of Thebes , where oak , persea and olive are also found , in a forest region nearly 40 miles from the Nile , watered by springs that rise in it . This region also contains the Egyptian plum-tree , which is not unlike the thorn last mentioned ; its fruit resembles a medlar , and ripens in the winter , and the tree is an evergreen .
SOL But the country in the neighbourhood of Carthage claims by the name of Punic apple what some call the pomegranate ; this it has also split up into classes , by giving the name of apyrenum to the variety that lacks a woody kernel : the consistency of this is whiter than that of the others , and its pips have a more agreeable taste and the membranes enclosing them are not so bitter ; but in other respects these apples have a special structure resembling the cells in a honeycomb , which is common to all that have a kernel .

But the Cyprian fig puts out a bud without any leaves , resembling a root . The trunk of the tree is like a poplar , and the leaf like an elm . It bears fruit four times a year , and also buds the same number of times , but its unripe figs will not ripen unless an incision is made in them to let out the juice .

The sandalis date , so called from its resemblance to a sandal , ranks fourth ; of this kind again there are said to be at the most five trees in existence , on the border of Ethiopia , and they are as remarkable for the sweetness of their fruit as they are for their rarity . Next to these the most famous are the caryotae , which supply a great deal of food but also of juice , and from which the principal wines of the East are made ; these strongly affect the head , to which the date owes its name .

They also differ in size , many having reached half a yard in length while some are no larger than a bean . The best kinds for keeping are those that grow in salt and sandy soils , for instance in Judea and the Cyrenaic district of Africa ; the dates in Egypt , Cyprus , Syria and Seleucia in Assyria do not keep , and consequently are used for fattening swine and other stock . It is a sign that the fruit is spoilt or old if the white excrescence by which the dates are attached to the cluster has fallen off . Soldiers of Alexander were choked by eating green dates ; this effect was produced in the Gedrosi country by the quality of the fruit , and occurs elsewhere from eating it to excess , for fresh dates are so sweet that people will not stop eating them except because of the danger . SOL Syria has several trees that are peculiar to it beside this date ; in the class of nuts the pistachio is well-known : it is reported that taken either in food or in drink it is a remedy for snakebite . In the fig class Syria has the Carians and smaller figs of the same class called cottana , also the plum that grows on Mount Damascus and the myxa , both now acclimated in Italy . In Egypt the myxa is also used for making wine .

Still , if even these matters deserve to be graded after a fashion , we find in the works left by Marcus Cicero that unguents that have an earthy scent are more agreeable than those smelling of saffron , inasmuch as even in a class of things where corruption is most rife , nevertheless some degree of strictness in vice itself gives more enjoyment . But there are people who get most pleasure from unguent of a dense consistency , which they call thick essence , and who enjoy smearing themselves with perfume and not merely pouring it over them . We have even seen people put scent on the soles of their feet , a practice said to have been taught to the emperor Nero by Marcus Otho ; pray , how could it be noticed or give any pleasure from that part of the body ? Moreover , we have heard that somebody of private station gave orders for the walls of his bathroom to be sprinkled with scent , and that the Emperor Caligula had the bathtubs scented , and so also later did one of the slaves of Nero — so that this must not be considered a privilege of princes ! Yet what is most surprising is that this indulgence has found its way even into the camp : at all events the eagles and the standards , dusty as they are and bristling with sharp points , are anointed on holidays — and I only wish we were able to say who first introduced this custom ! No doubt the fact is that our eagles were bribed by this reward to conquer the world ! We look to their patronage forsooth to sanction our vices , so as to have this legitimation for using hair-oil under a helmet !

SOL Phoenicia has a small variety of cedar that resembles a juniper . It is of two kinds , the Lycian and the Phoenician , which have different leaves ; the one with a hard , prickly , pointed leaf is called the oxycedros , while the other is a branchy tree and the wood is full of knots and has a better scent .

The same island also produces a goat-thorn , which has the root of the white thorn , and is much preferred to the goat-thorn growing in the country of the Medes or in Achaia ; its price is 3 denarii per pound . SOL Asia also produces the goat-plant or scorpio , a thorn without leaves and with reddish branches , used for medicinal purposes : Italy also has the myrica , which is there called the tamarisk , and Achaia the wild brya ; a remarkable property of the brya is that only the cultivated kind bears fruit ; this resembles a gall-nut . In Syria and Egypt this shrub is abundant , and we give the name of unlucky wood to its timber ; yet some of the timbers of Greece are unluckier , for Greece grows a tree named the ostrys , another form of the name being ostrya , which grows by itself round rocks washed by water ; it is like an ash in its bark and branches , and a pear in its leaf , though the leaves are a little longer and thicker and wrinkled with indentations running all across them ; the seed resembles barley in colour as well as shape . The wood is hard and solid , and it is said that if it is brought into a house it causes difficulty in childbirth and painful deaths .

This process may enable records to last a long time ; at the house of the poet and most distinguished citizen Pomponius Secundus I have seen documents in the hand of Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus written nearly two hundred years ago ; while as for autographs of Cicero , of his late Majesty Augustus , and of Virgil , we see them constantly . SOL There are important instances forthcoming that make against the opinion of Marcus Varro in regard to the history of paper . Cassius Hemina , a historian of great antiquity , has stated in his Annals , Book 4 , that the secretary Gnaeus Terentius , when digging over his land on the Janiculan , turned up a coffer that had contained the body of Numa , who was king at Rome , and that in the same coffer were found some books of his — this was in the consulship of Publius 181 BC . Cornelius Cethegus , son of Lucius , and of Marcus Baebius Tamphilus , son of Quintus , dating 535 years after the accession of Numa ; and the historian says that the books were made of paper , which makes the matter still more remarkable , because of their having lasted in a hole in the ground , and consequently on a point of such importance I will quote the words of Hemina himself : ' Other people wondered how those books could have lasted so long , but Terentius 's explanation was that about in the middle of the coffer there had been a square stone tied all round with waxed cords , and that the three books had been placed on the top of this stone ; and he thought this position was the reason why they had not decayed ; and that the books had been soaked in citrus-oil , and he thought that this was why they were not moth-eaten . These books contained the philosophical doctrines of Pythagoras' — and Hemina said that the books had been burnt by the praetor Quintus Petilius because they were writings of philosophy [ prob. an interpolation ] . The same story is recorded by Piso the former Censor in his Commentaries , Book I , but he says that there were seven volumes of pontifical law and the same number of Pythagorean philosophy ; while Tuditanus in Book X3 says that there were twelve volumes of the Decrees of Numa ; Varro himself says that there were seven volumes of Antiquities of Man , and Antias in his Second Book speaks of there having been twelve volumes On Matters Pontifical written in Latin and the same number in Greek containing Doctrines of Philosophy ; Antias also quotes in Book 3 a Resolution of the Senate deciding that these volumes were to be burnt .

SOL Asia also produces the goat-plant or scorpio , a thorn without leaves and with reddish branches , used for medicinal purposes : Italy also has the myrica , which is there called the tamarisk , and Achaia the wild brya ; a remarkable property of the brya is that only the cultivated kind bears fruit ; this resembles a gall-nut . In Syria and Egypt this shrub is abundant , and we give the name of unlucky wood to its timber ; yet some of the timbers of Greece are unluckier , for Greece grows a tree named the ostrys , another form of the name being ostrya , which grows by itself round rocks washed by water ; it is like an ash in its bark and branches , and a pear in its leaf , though the leaves are a little longer and thicker and wrinkled with indentations running all across them ; the seed resembles barley in colour as well as shape . The wood is hard and solid , and it is said that if it is brought into a house it causes difficulty in childbirth and painful deaths . SOL Equally unlucky is the tree on the island of Lesbos called the euonymus , which is not unlike the pomegranate tree — its leaves are between pomegranate and bay-leaves in size , but have the shape and soft texture of the leaf of the pomegranate — and which by the scent of its white blossom gives prompt warning of its pestilential qualities . It bears a pod like that of the sesame , with a coarse square-shaped grain inside it which is deadly for animals ; and the leaf also has the same property , although sometimes an immediate evacuation of the bowels gives relief . SOL Cornelius Alexander mentions a tree called the hon-tree , the timber of which he says was used to build the Argo , which bears mistletoe resembling that on the oak , and which cannot be rotted by water or destroyed by fire , the same being the case with its mistletoe .

It serves the same purpose as vetch , but produces satiety more quickly , an animal being fattened by quite a moderate amount — so much so that beasts of burden fed on it refuse barley . No other fodder produces a larger quantity or a better quality of milk , and above everything as a medicine for cattle it renders them immune from all diseases .

Some people make an incision in the stalk during harvest-time and make a hollow in the root itself for the juice to collect in , and when it has dried take it away ; others pound the leaves and stalk and root in a mortar and after drying the juice hard in the sun cut it up into lozenges . The emperor Nero at the beginning of his reign gave this juice a famous advertisement , as when during his nocturnal escapades his face had sustained a number of bruises he smeared it with a mixture of thapsia , frankincense and wax and on the following day gave the lie to rumour by going about with a whole skin . It is a well-known fact that fire can be best kept alight in a fennel stalk , and that the fennels in Egypt are the best . SOL In Egypt also grows the caper-tree , a shrub with a rather hard wood ; also its seed is well known as an article of food , and is usually gathered together with the stalk . Its foreign varieties should be avoided , inasmuch as the Arabian kind is poisonous and the African injures the gums , and that from Marmarica , is injurious to the womb . Also the Apulian caper-tree produces vomiting and diarrhoea by causing flatulence in all the organs .

If sown the seed is soaked , or , if there is a shortage of rain , it is watered after sowing . When the plants are 18 inches high they are replanted in a trench a foot deep . This planting is done through the equinoxes , while the shrub is still tender ; it takes three years to mature , and it is cut at the spring equinox , when it has done flowering — a job that can be done very cheaply even by a boy or an old woman .

Some people hold it enough to add a sprinkle of the most expensive ingredients to the others after boiling them down , as an economy , but the mixture has not the same strength unless they are all boiled down together . Myrrh even when used by itself without oil makes an unguent , provided that the staete kind is used — otherwise it produces too bitter a flavour . Unguent of cyprus produces a green colour , lily unguent gives a greasy consistency , oil of Mendes makes the mixture black , attar of roses white , and myrrh gives a pale hue .

It is a well-known fact that fire can be best kept alight in a fennel stalk , and that the fennels in Egypt are the best . SOL In Egypt also grows the caper-tree , a shrub with a rather hard wood ; also its seed is well known as an article of food , and is usually gathered together with the stalk . Its foreign varieties should be avoided , inasmuch as the Arabian kind is poisonous and the African injures the gums , and that from Marmarica , is injurious to the womb . Also the Apulian caper-tree produces vomiting and diarrhoea by causing flatulence in all the organs . Some persons call this shrub ' dog-brier ,' others ' snake-vine ' . SOL The saripha growing on the banks of the Nile also belongs to the shrub class . It is about 3 ft. high and the thickness of a man 's thumb ; its foliage is that of the papyrus , and it is chewed in a similar manner . The root is highly rated in workshops for use as fuel , because of its hardness .

It has a broad leaf and is coloured green ; and it produces a growth one of the Greek names for which means ' leek-weed ' and the other ' bind-weed . ' Another variety of the same shrub has a hair-like leaf resembling fennel , and grows on rocks , while the one above grows in shallow water near the coast ; both kinds shoot in springtime and die off in autumn . The phycos growing on rocks round the island of Crete is also used for a purple dye ; the most approved kind being that growing on the northern side of the island , as is the case in regard to sponges . A third variety resembles a grass ; its root is knotted , and so is its stalk , like the stalk of a reed . SOL Another group of shrubs is called bryon , which has the leaf of a lettuce only more wrinkled . This grows lower down than the one last mentioned ; but in deep water grow a pine and an oak , each 18 inches high ; they have shells clinging to their branches . The oak is reported to provide a dye for woollen fabrics , and some in deep water are actually said to bear acorns , these facts having been ascertained by shipwrecked persons and by divers . Also other very large marine trees are reported in the neighbourhood of Sikyon — for the sea-vine grows everywhere , but there is a sea-fig , which has no leaves and a red bark , and also the class of marine shrubs includes a sea-palm . Outside the Straits of Gibraltar grows a marine shrub with the leaf of a leek , and another with the foliage of a bay-tree and of thyme ; both of these when thrown up ashore by the waves turn into pumice .

The damping process if carelessly applied often causes difficulty in writing at first , and it can be detected by a blow with the mallet , or even by the musty smell if the process has been rather carelessly carried out . Spottiness also may be detected by the eye , but a bad porous strip found inserted in the middle of the pasted joins , owing to the sponginess of the papyrus , sucks up the ink and so can scarcely be detected except when the ink of a letter runs : so much opportunity is there for cheating .

The perfume most highly praised in the old days was made on the island of Delos , but later that from the Egyptian town of Mendes ranked the highest . Nor was this only the result of the blending and combination of several scents , but the same juices gained supremacy or degenerated in various ways in different places . The sword-lily perfume of Corinth was extremely popular for a long time , but afterwards that of Cyzicus , and similarly the attar of roses made at Phaselis , but this distinction was later taken from it by Naples , Capua and Praeneste . Oil of saffron from Soli in Cilicia was for a long time praised most highly , but subsequently that of Rhodes ; vine-flower scent made in Cyprus was preferred , but afterwards that from Adramytteum , and scent of marjoram made in Cos , but afterwards quince-blossom unguent from the same place , and cyprus-scent made in Cyprus , but subsequently that made in Egypt ; at this point scent from Mendes and almond-oil suddenly became more popular , but later on Phoenicia appropriated these two scents and left the credit for cyprus-scent to Egypt . Athens has persistently maintained the credit of her ' all-Athenian ' perfume .
The first case that I am able to discover was when a chest of perfumes was captured by Alexander among the rest of the property of King Darius when his camp was taken . Afterwards the pleasure of perfume was also admitted by our fellow-countrymen as well among the most elegant and also most honourable enjoyments of life , and even began to be an appropriate tribute to the dead ; and consequently we will enlarge on the subject .

The sumach is used for bleaching leather . The seed , which resembles a lentil , turns red at the same time as the grapes ; it is called rhus and is required for certain drugs . SOL Egypt also has many kinds of trees not found anywhere else , before all a fig , which is consequently called the Egyptian fig. The tree resembles a mulberry in foliage , size and appearance ; it bears its fruit not on the branches but on the trunk itself , and this is an exceedingly sweet fig without seeds inside it . There is an extremely prolific yield , but only if incisions are made in the fruit with iron hooks , otherwise it does not ripen ; but when this is done , it can be plucked three days later , another fig forming in its place , the tree thus scoring seven crops of extremely juicy figs in a summer . Even if the incisions are not made new fruit forms under the old and drives out its predecessor before it is ripe four times in a summer . The wood of this fig is of a peculiar kind , and is one of the most useful there is . As soon as it is cut it is plunged into a marsh , and at first sinks to the bottom , but afterwards begins to float , and it is clear that moisture not belonging to it , which soaks into all other timber , drains the sap out of this .
The flower is called balaustium , and is serviceable for doctors and also for dyeing cloth ; it has given its name to a special colour .

SOL It is agreed that the Egyptian thorn supplies the best kind of gum ; it is of a streaked appearance , grey in colour , clean and free from bark , and it sticks to the teeth ; its price is 3 denarii per pound . The gum produced from the bitter almond and the cherry is inferior , and that from plum-trees is the worst kind of all . A gum also forms in the vine which is extremely valuable for children 's sores , and the gum sometimes found in the olive-tree is good for toothache ; but the gun 's also found in the elm on Mount Corycus in Cilicia and in the juniper are of no use for anything , indeed elm-tree gum there even breeds gnats . Also a gum exudes from the sarcocolla that is the name of the tree and also of the gum — which is extremely useful both to painters and to medical men ; it resembles incense dust , and for the purposes mentioned the white kind is better than the red ; its price is the one mentioned above . SOL We have not yet touched on the marsh-plants nor the shrubs that grow by rivers . But before we leave Egypt we shall also describe the nature of papyrus , since our civilization or at all events our records depend very largely on the employment of paper . According to Marcus Varro we owe even the discovery of paper to the victory of Alexander the Great , when he founded Alexandria in Egypt , before which time paper was not used .

According to Marcus Varro we owe even the discovery of paper to the victory of Alexander the Great , when he founded Alexandria in Egypt , before which time paper was not used . First of all people used to write on palm-leaves and then on the bark of certain trees , and afterwards folding sheets of lead began to be employed for official muniments , and then also sheets of linen or tablets of wax for private documents ; for we find in Homer that the use of writing-tablets existed even before the Trojan period , but when he was writing even the land itself which is now thought of as Egypt did not exist as such , while now paper grows in the Sebennytic and Saitic nomes of Egypt , the land having been subsequently heaped up by the Nile , inasmuch as Homer wrote that the island of Pharos , which is now joined to Alexandria by a bridge , was twenty-four hours' distance by sailing-ship from the land .

A further point reported is that in the Euphrates both the head itself and the flower at the evening go on submerging till midnight , and disappear entirely into the depth so that they cannot be found even by plunging the hand in , and then return and by degrees straighten up again , and at sunrise come out of the water and open their flower , and still go on rising so that the flower is raised up quite a long way above the water . The lotus has a root of the size of a quince , enclosed in a black skin like the shell of a chestnut ; inside it has a white body , agreeable to eat raw but still more agreeable when boiled in water or roasted in the ashes . Its peelings are more useful than any other fodder for fattening pigs . SOL The region of the Cyrenaica ranks the lotus below its own Christ's-thorn . This is more in the nature of a shrub , and its fruit is redder , and contains a kernel that is eaten by itself , as it is agreeable alone ; it is improved by being dipped in wine , and moreover its juice improves wine . The interior of Africa as far as the Garamantes and the desert is covered with palms remarkable for their size and their luscious fruit , the most celebrated being in the neighbourhood of the temple of Ammon . SOL But the country in the neighbourhood of Carthage claims by the name of Punic apple what some call the pomegranate ; this it has also split up into classes , by giving the name of apyrenum to the variety that lacks a woody kernel : the consistency of this is whiter than that of the others , and its pips have a more agreeable taste and the membranes enclosing them are not so bitter ; but in other respects these apples have a special structure resembling the cells in a honeycomb , which is common to all that have a kernel . Of these there are five kinds , the sweet , the sour , the mixed , the acid and the vinous ; those of Samos and of Egypt are divided into the red-leaved and the white-leaved varieties .

Oil of saffron from Soli in Cilicia was for a long time praised most highly , but subsequently that of Rhodes ; vine-flower scent made in Cyprus was preferred , but afterwards that from Adramytteum , and scent of marjoram made in Cos , but afterwards quince-blossom unguent from the same place , and cyprus-scent made in Cyprus , but subsequently that made in Egypt ; at this point scent from Mendes and almond-oil suddenly became more popular , but later on Phoenicia appropriated these two scents and left the credit for cyprus-scent to Egypt . Athens has persistently maintained the credit of her ' all-Athenian ' perfume . There was also once an unguent called panther-scent at Tarsus , even the recipe for compounding which has disappeared ; narcissus-scent has also ceased to be made from the narcissus flower . SOL The recipe for making unguents contains two ingredients , the juice and the solid part , the former which usually consists of various sorts of oil and the latter of scented substances , the oils being called ' astringents' and the scents ' sweetenings . ' Together with these there is a third factor that many people neglect — that of colour , for the sake of which cinnabar and alkanet should be added . A sprinkle of salt serves to preserve the properties of the oil , but to scents containing an admixture of alkanet salt is not added . Resin or gum are added to retain the scent in the solid part , as it evaporates and disappears very quickly if these are not added .

The first quality used to be called ' hieratic paper ' and was in early times devoted solely to books connected with religion , but in a spirit of flattery it was given the name of Augustus , just as the second best was called ' Livia paper ' after his consort , and thus the name ' hieratic ' came down to the third class . The next quality had been given the name of ' amphitheatre ' paper , from the place of its manufacture .
The roots are employed by the natives for timber , and not only to serve as firewood but also for making various utensils and vessels ; indeed the papyrus itself is plaited to make boats , and the inner bark is woven into sail-cloth and matting , and also cloth , as well as blankets and ropes .

The same story is recorded by Piso the former Censor in his Commentaries , Book I , but he says that there were seven volumes of pontifical law and the same number of Pythagorean philosophy ; while Tuditanus in Book X3 says that there were twelve volumes of the Decrees of Numa ; Varro himself says that there were seven volumes of Antiquities of Man , and Antias in his Second Book speaks of there having been twelve volumes On Matters Pontifical written in Latin and the same number in Greek containing Doctrines of Philosophy ; Antias also quotes in Book 3 a Resolution of the Senate deciding that these volumes were to be burnt . It is however universally agreed that the Sibyl brought three volumes to Tarquin the Proud , of which two were burnt by herself while the third was destroyed in the burning of the Capitol in the Sulla crisis . Moreover the Mucianus who was three times consul has stated that recently , when governor of Lycia , he had read in a certain temple a letter of Sarpedon written on paper at Troy — which seems to me even more remarkable if even when Homer was writing , Egypt did not yet exist : otherwise why , if paper was already in use , is it known to have been the custom to write on folding tablets made of lead or sheets of linen , or why has Homer stated that even in Lycia itself wooden tablets , and not letters , were given to Bellerophon ? This commodity also is liable to dearth , and as early as the principate of Tiberius a shortage of paper led to the appointment from the senate of umpires to supervise its distribution , as otherwise life was completely upset . SOL Ethiopia , which is on the borders of Egypt , has virtually no remarkable trees except the wool-tree , like the one described among the trees of India and Arabia . However , the Ethiopian variety has a much woollier consistency , and a larger pod , like that of a pomegranate , and also the trees themselves resemble each other . Beside the wool-tree there are also palms of the kind which we have described . The trees and the scented forests of the islands round the coast of Ethiopia have been spoken of when those islands were mentioned . SOL Mount Atlas is said to possess a forest of a remarkable character , about which we have spoken . Adjoining Mount Atlas is Mauretania , which produces a great many citrus-trees — and the tablemania which the ladies use as a retort to the men against the charge of extravagance in pearls .

The seas are full of sea-dogs , so much so that it is scarcely safe for a sailor to keep a lookout from the bows — in fact they frequently go for the actual oars . SOL The soldiers of Alexander who sailed from India gave an account of some marine trees the foliage of which was green while in the water but dried up in the sun as soon as it was taken out and turned into salt ; they also reported that along the coasts there were bulrushes of stone which exactly resembled real ones , and out in deep water certain shrubs of the colour of cow-horn where they branched out and turning red at the top ; they were brittle , like glass when handled , but turned red-hot in fire like iron , their proper colour coming back again when they had cooled off .

As soon as it is cut it is plunged into a marsh , and at first sinks to the bottom , but afterwards begins to float , and it is clear that moisture not belonging to it , which soaks into all other timber , drains the sap out of this . When it begins to float on the surface , this is its sign that the timber is ready for use . SOL A tree to some extent resembling the Egyptian fig is one in Crete called the Cyprian fig , as it also bears fruit on its actual trunk and on its branches when they have grown to thickness . But the Cyprian fig puts out a bud without any leaves , resembling a root . The trunk of the tree is like a poplar , and the leaf like an elm .
The seed is oblong in shape and not rounded like an olive-stone , and also it is split at the back by a bulging cleft , and in most cases shaped like a navel at the middle of the bulge : it is from here that the root first spreads out .

SOL Asia also produces the goat-plant or scorpio , a thorn without leaves and with reddish branches , used for medicinal purposes : Italy also has the myrica , which is there called the tamarisk , and Achaia the wild brya ; a remarkable property of the brya is that only the cultivated kind bears fruit ; this resembles a gall-nut . In Syria and Egypt this shrub is abundant , and we give the name of unlucky wood to its timber ; yet some of the timbers of Greece are unluckier , for Greece grows a tree named the ostrys , another form of the name being ostrya , which grows by itself round rocks washed by water ; it is like an ash in its bark and branches , and a pear in its leaf , though the leaves are a little longer and thicker and wrinkled with indentations running all across them ; the seed resembles barley in colour as well as shape . The wood is hard and solid , and it is said that if it is brought into a house it causes difficulty in childbirth and painful deaths . SOL Equally unlucky is the tree on the island of Lesbos called the euonymus , which is not unlike the pomegranate tree — its leaves are between pomegranate and bay-leaves in size , but have the shape and soft texture of the leaf of the pomegranate — and which by the scent of its white blossom gives prompt warning of its pestilential qualities .

All over the Thebaid and Arabia the dates are dry and small , with a shrivelled body , and as they are scorched by the continual heat their covering is more truly a rind than a skin . Indeed in Ethiopia itself the climate is so dry that the skin of these dates is rubbed into powder and kneaded to make loaves of bread like flour . This date grows on a shrub , with branches eighteen inches long , a rather broad leaf , and fruit of a round shape , but larger than the size of an apple . The Greek name for this date is koix ; it comes to maturity in three years , and the shrub always has fruit on it. another date sprouting in place of one picked . The date of the Thebaid is packed into casks at once , before it has lost the aroma of its natural heat ; if this is not done , it quickly loses its freshness and dries up unless it is warmed up again in an oven . SOL Of the rest of the date kind the Syrian variety , called sweetmeats , seem to be a low-class fruit ; for those in the other part of Phoenicia and Cilicia have the local name of acorn-dates , also used by us . These too are of several kinds , differing in shape , some rounder and others longer , and also in colour , some being blacker and others reddish ; indeed , they are reported to have as many varieties of colour as the fig ! though the white ones are the most in favour .

The variety of this class which we offer to the honour of the gods is called chydaeus by the Jews , a race remarkable for their contempt for the divine powers . All over the Thebaid and Arabia the dates are dry and small , with a shrivelled body , and as they are scorched by the continual heat their covering is more truly a rind than a skin . Indeed in Ethiopia itself the climate is so dry that the skin of these dates is rubbed into powder and kneaded to make loaves of bread like flour . This date grows on a shrub , with branches eighteen inches long , a rather broad leaf , and fruit of a round shape , but larger than the size of an apple .
Their outstanding property is the unctuous juice which they exude and an extremely sweet sort of wine-flavour like that of honey . The Nicholas date belonging to this class is not so juicy but exceptionally large in size , four put end to end making a length of eighteen inches .

But the Cyprian fig puts out a bud without any leaves , resembling a root . The trunk of the tree is like a poplar , and the leaf like an elm .
There is an extremely prolific yield , but only if incisions are made in the fruit with iron hooks , otherwise it does not ripen ; but when this is done , it can be plucked three days later , another fig forming in its place , the tree thus scoring seven crops of extremely juicy figs in a summer .

This commodity also is liable to dearth , and as early as the principate of Tiberius a shortage of paper led to the appointment from the senate of umpires to supervise its distribution , as otherwise life was completely upset . SOL Ethiopia , which is on the borders of Egypt , has virtually no remarkable trees except the wool-tree , like the one described among the trees of India and Arabia .

And so fully is their sexual union understood that mankind has actually devised a method of impregnating them by means of the flower and down collected from the males , and indeed sometimes by merely sprinkling their pollen on the females . SOL Palms are also propagated by layering , the trunk for a length of three feet from the actual brain of the tree being divided by incisions and dug into the ground . Also a slip torn off from the root makes a hardy growth when planted , and so does one from the youngest of the branches .
This woody core is divided from the fleshy parts by a number of white coats , others clinging closely to its body ; and it is loose and separate , only attached by a thread at its top end . The flesh takes a year to ripen , though in some places , for instance , Cyprus , it has a pleasant sweet flavour even though it does not reach maturity . In Cyprus the leaf is broader and the fruit rounder than it is elsewhere , though people there do not eat the body of the fruit , but spit it out after merely squeezing out the juice .

Unguent of cyprus produces a green colour , lily unguent gives a greasy consistency , oil of Mendes makes the mixture black , attar of roses white , and myrrh gives a pale hue . SOL These are the kinds of perfumes invented in early times , and the subsequent pilferings of the factories . We will now speak of what is the very climax of luxury and the most important example of this commodity . SOL What then is called the ' royal ' unguent , because it is a blend prepared for the kings of Parthia , is made of behen-nut juice , costus , amomum , Syrian cinnamon , cardamom , spikenard , cat-thyme , myrrh , cinnamon-bark , styrax-tree gum , ladanum , balm , Syrian reed and Syrian rush , wild grape , cinnamon - - , serichatum , cyprus , rosewood , all-heal , saffron , gladiolus , marjoram , lotus , honey and wine . And none of the components of this scent is grown in Italy , the conqueror of the world , and indeed none in the whole of Europe excepting The iris in Illyria and nard in Gaul — for as to wine and roses and myrtle leaves and olive oil , they may be taken as belonging to pretty well all countries in common .
