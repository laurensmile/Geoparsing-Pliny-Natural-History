It is adulterated by the Sicilian salt I have said comes from the lake Cocanicus , as well as by Cyprian salt , which is wonderfully like it . In Hither Spain too at Egelesta salt is cut into almost transparent blocks ; to this for some time past most physicians have given the first place among all kinds of salt . Every region in which salt is found is barren , and nothing will grow there . To speak generally , these remarks about the various kinds of native salt are comprehensive . Of artificial salt there are various kinds . The usual one , and the most plentiful , is made in salt pools by running into them sea water not without streams of fresh water , but rain helps very much , and above all much warm sunshine , without which it does not dry out . In Africa around Utica are formed heaps of salt like hills ; when they have hardened under sun and moon , they are not melted by any moisture , and even iron cuts them with difficulty .

SOL The nature of salt is of itself fiery , and yet it is hostile to fires , fleeing from them , corroding all things , but astringent to the body , drying it and binding , preserving corpses also from corruption so that they last for ages ; in medicine however it is mordent , caustic , cleansing , reducing , and resolvent , injurious only to the stomach except in so far as it stimulates the appetite .
Allen however itself is of some use in healing . For allex both cures itch in sheep , being poured into an incision in the skin , and is a good antidote for the bites of dog or sea draco ; it is applied on pieces of lint .

Theopompus also says that near Cychri in Thrace are deadly waters , Lycos that at Leontini is water that kills on the third day after drinking , and Varro that on Soracte is poisonous water in a spring four feet wide . At sunrise , he adds , this bubbles out as though it boiled , and birds that have tasted it lie dead close by . For certain waters have also this insidious property , that the very prospect is attractive ; as at Nonacris in Arcadia , which has nothing at all about it to serve as a warning . They think that this water harms by its excessive cold , seeing that as it flows it itself turns to stone . It is otherwise around Tempe in Thessaly , for its poison is a terror to everyone , and they tell us that by the water there even bronze and iron are corroded . It flows , as I have pointed out , for only a short distance , and a marvellous thing is related of this spring : it is embraced by the roots of a wild carob always bearing purple blossom . And a unique kind of herb flourishes on the margins of the spring .

To refute this view is a matter that is important to all men . For first of all , this lightness of water can be discovered with difficulty except by sensation , as the kinds of water differ practically nothing in weight .
But at Mieza in Macedonia the drops actually hang from the arched roofs , while in the Corinthian cave they petrify after falling ; in certain caverns the stone forms in both ways and makes pillars , as at Phausia in the Chersonesus opposite to Rhodes in a huge cave , where the pillars are actually of different colours to look at . These examples must be enough for the present . SOL It is a question debated by the physicians what kinds of water are most beneficial . They rightly condemn stagnant and sluggish waters , holding that running water is more beneficial , as it is made finer and more healthy by the mere agitation of the current . For this reason I am surprised that some physicians recommend highly water from cisterns .

In the whole world one spring of water only is said to have a pleasant smell , and that is at Chabura in Mesopotamia ; a reason is sought in the legend that with it Juno was bathed . Apart from this wholesome water should have no sort of taste or smell . SOL Some judge the wholesomeness of water by means of the balance . This is wasted carefulness , for it is very rare for one water to be lighter than another .
But the nitrous and salty-acid streams that in the desert flow to the Red Sea are made sweet within two hours if pearl barley is added , and the barley itself they eat . Especially are condemned waters that have mud at their source , and those that give a bad colour to those who drink of them . It also makes a difference if water stains bronze vessels , or if it cooks greens slowly , if when gently filtered out it leaves a sediment of earth , or when boiled thickly encrusts the vessel .

For the bites of serpents it is used with origanum , honey , and hyssop , for the cerastes with origanum and cedar resin , or pitch , or honey . It is helpful for bite of the scolopendra if taken internally with vinegar , for scorpion stings if applied in oil or vinegar with a fourth part of linseed , but for hornets , wasps , and similar creatures , in vinegar only , for migraine , ulcers on the head , blisters , pimples , and incipient warts , with veal suet . It is also used in eye remedies , for excrescences of flesh there , and for pterygia anywhere on the body , but especially on the eyes , and so it is an ingredient of eye salves and plasters ; for these purposes Tattaean salt or that of Cannus is the most approved .

The first to begin the bringing of this water to Rome was one of the kings , Ancus Marcius ; later , repairs were carried out by Quintus Marcius Rex in his praetorship , and again by Marcus Agrippa . SOL The same Agrippa also brought the Aqua Virgo to Rome from the byroad , eight miles away , that extends two miles along the road to Praeneste . Nearby is the stream of Hercules , and because the Aqua Virgo runs away from this it was so named . A comparison of these rivers illustrates the difference mentioned above ; for the Aqua Marcia is as much superior to swallow as the Aqua Virgo is cool to touch .

The pains of fatigue are removed by rubbing all over with soda , oil , and vinegar , while for chills and shivers it is of advantage to rub the hands and feet thoroughly with soda and oil . It also checks the itch of jaundice , especially when administered with vinegar while the patient is sweating .
Dissolved in wine it is poured into purulent ears ; wax in the same organ it eats away in vinegar ; noises and singing it stops if added dry . Applied in sunshine with vinegar and an equal weight of Cimolian chalk it cures the white kinds of psoriasis . It brings to a head boils , either mixed with resin or with white raisins , the pips being ground up with them . With axle-grease it combats inflammation of the testicles , and also outbursts of phlegm on the whole body ; it is applied with vinegar , resin being added , to dog-bites .

Some have also given it to be drunk in quartan agues , in tenesmus , and for diseased joints , keeping it for this purpose , for age takes away its injurious qualities .

Flower of salt forms only with north winds . Tragasaean salt and Acanthian , so named after towns , neither crackles nor sputters in a fire , nor does froth of any salt , or scrapings , or powder . Salt of Agrigentum submits to fire and sputters in water . The colour too of salt varies : blushing red at Memphis , tawny red near the Oxus , purple at Centuripae , it is of such brightness near Gela ( also in Sicily ) that it reflects an image . In Cappadoeia salt is quarried of a saffron colour , transparent , and very fragrant . For medicinal purposes the ancients used to favour most highly Tarentine salt , next , all kinds of sea salt , and of these especially that from foam , while for the eyes of draught animals and cattle salt of Tragasa and Baetica . To season meats and foods the most useful otter one melts easily and is rather moist , for it is less bitter , such as that of Attica and Euboea .

Moreover sheep , cattle , and draught animals are encouraged to pasture in particular by salt ; the supply of milk is much more copious , and there is even a far more pleasing quality in the cheese .

This led afterwards to the discovery of salt by digging away the sand even in the rough tracts between Egypt and Arabia , as it is also found as far as the oracle of Hammon through the parched deserts of Africa , where at night it increases as the moon waxes . But the region of Cyrenaica too is famous for Hammoniac salt , itself so called because it is found under the sand . It is in colour like the alum called schiston , consisting of long opaque slabs , of an unpleasant flavour , but useful in medicine . That is most valued which is most transparent and splits into straight flakes . A remarkable feature is reported of it : of very little weight in its underground pits , when brought into the light of day it becomes incredibly heavy . The reason is obvious ; the damp breath of the pits helps the workers by supporting the weight as does water .

SOL The same method of treatment will also apply to sea water , which is used hot for pains in the sinews , for joining fractured bones , and for bruised bones ; also for drying the body , in which treatment cold sea water is also employed . There are besides many other uses , the chief however being a sea voyage for those attacked by consumption , as I have said , and for haemoptysis , such as quite recently within our memory was taken by Annaeus Gallio after his consulship . Egypt is not chosen for its own sake , but because of the length of the voyage . Moreover the mere seasickness caused by rolling and pitching are good for very many ailments of the head , eyes , and chest , as well as for all complaints for which hellebore is given .

With vinegar or cold water they arrest haemorrhage , with hot salt and water , often changed , they remove fresh bruises caused by a blow , and with vinegar and water they cure swollen and painful testicles . For dog-bite are applied beneficially with vinegar , cold water , or honey , cut-off pieces of sponge , which must be thoroughly moistened every now and then . The ash of the African sponge , swallowed with the juice of cut-leek , is good for spitting of blood ; for other complaints it should be taken in cold water . This ash also , applied to the forehead with oil or vinegar , cures tertian agues . African sponges are specific with vinegar and water for reducing swellings , and the ash of all sponges burnt with pitch arrest haemorrhage from wounds ; for this purpose some burn with pitch only sponges of loose texture .
In the treatment of wounds sponges with salt and water also act as a substitute for greasy wool ; the difference is that wools soften , but sponges are astringent and absorb quickly the diseased humours of ulcers . They are also bound round dropsical parts , either dry or with warm water or vinegar and water , whenever there is need to soothe , or cover a the skin , or dry it .

SOL The first prize for the coolest and most wholesome water in the whole world has been awarded by the voice of Rome to the Aqua Marcia , one of the gods' gifts to our city . This was once called the Aqua Aufeia , and the source itself Aqua Pitonia . It rises at the extreme end of the Paelignian range , crosses the country of the Marsi and the Fucine lake , plainly making straight for Rome . Next it sinks into the underground caves near Tibur , reappearing and completing its journey of nine more miles along an aqueduct . The first to begin the bringing of this water to Rome was one of the kings , Ancus Marcius ; later , repairs were carried out by Quintus Marcius Rex in his praetorship , and again by Marcus Agrippa .

Alkaline water , however , is found in very many places , but the soda is not concentrated enough to solidify . At Clitae in Macedonia is found in abundance the best , called soda of Chalestra , white and pure , very like salt . There is an alkaline lake there with a little spring of fresh water rising up in the centre . Soda forms in it about the rising of the Dog-star for nine days , ceases for nine days , comes to the top again and then ceases . This shows that it is the character of the soil that produces soda , since it has been discovered that , when it ceases , neither sunshine is of any help at all nor yet rain .

In the soda-beds nobody has ophthalmia ; sores brought there heal very quickly , but those that form there heal slowly . Soda and oil also make to sweat those who are rubbed with the mixture , which softens the flesh . They use Chalestran soda for bread instead of salt , Egyptian soda for radishes ; it makes them more tender , but meats white and inferior and vegetables greener . In medicine soda warms , alleviates , stings , braces , dries , and clears away ulcers , and is useful for conditions where there must be withdrawal , dispersal , and gentle stinging and alleviation , as with pimples and blisters . Some for this purpose set it on fire and put it out with a dry wine , and use it so prepared and ground in the bath without oil . Excessive sweats are checked by soda with dried iris and the addition of green oil ; it also improves scars on the eyes and roughness of the lids if applied with fig , or boiled down to one half in raisin wine , a preparation too which is used for white ulcers and inflamed swellings on the eyes . Boiled down with raisin wine in a pomegranate rind , and applied with honey , it improves vision .

It is worth while recording that there is a country seat on the coast as you go from Lake Avernus to Puteoli , with a famous portico and grove , which lvi . Cicero , copying Athens , called Academia . There he wrote the volumes called Academica , and in it he also erected memorials to himself , as though indeed he had not done so throughout the whole world . In the front part of this estate , when the owner was Antistius Vetus , a short time after Cicero 's demise there burst out hot springs , very beneficial for eye complaints , which have been made famous by a poem of Laurea Tullus , who was one of Cicero 's freedmen .

Many have prescribed complete rubbing with soda and oil before the chills of fever come on , and so to use it for leprons sores and freckles ; and they prescribe its use in the bath for gouty people . Soda baths are good for consnmptives , and for the victims of opisthotonus and other forms of tetanus . Salt and soda , when heated with sulphur , turn to stone . SOL Of the kinds of sponges I have spoken when describing the nature of marine creatures . Certain authorities classify them thus : some sponges , the males , have little holes , and are more compact and very absorbent ; they are also dyed for the luxurious , sometimes even with purple ; others , the females , have larger and uninterrupted holes ; others , harder than the males , called tragi , have very small holes that are very close together . Sponges are whitened artificially . Fresh sponges , of the softest kind , are soaked in foam of salt throughout the summer , and then laid open to the moon and hoar-frosts upside down , that is , with the side uppermost that adhered to the rocks , so that they may drink in whiteness .
Juba says that among the Trogodytae is a lake called Insanus , so named from its evil character , for three times a day and three times each night it becomes bitter , and then again fresh , full of white serpents twenty cubits long ; he also says that in Arabia is a spring that bursts forth with such violence that it throws out everything , no matter how heavy , that is heaved into it .

Certain authorities classify them thus : some sponges , the males , have little holes , and are more compact and very absorbent ; they are also dyed for the luxurious , sometimes even with purple ; others , the females , have larger and uninterrupted holes ; others , harder than the males , called tragi , have very small holes that are very close together . Sponges are whitened artificially . Fresh sponges , of the softest kind , are soaked in foam of salt throughout the summer , and then laid open to the moon and hoar-frosts upside down , that is , with the side uppermost that adhered to the rocks , so that they may drink in whiteness . I have said that sponges are animal , being even lined with a coating of blood . Some also declare that they are guided by a sense of hearing , and contract at a noise , sending out a great quantity of moisture ; that they cannot be torn from the rocks , and therefore are cut off , bleeding sanies . Moreover , those growing exposed to the north-east they prefer to others , and physicians declare that nowhere else does their breath last for a longer time .

It is also an ingredient of plasters , especially white plasters and poultices . It is beneficially used too when poured over in frequent douches . It is also drunk , though not without harm to the stomach , for purging the body and for getting rid of black bile or clotted blood by vomit or stool . Some have also given it to be drunk in quartan agues , in tenesmus , and for diseased joints , keeping it for this purpose , for age takes away its injurious qualities . Some boil it ; all draw it up out at sea , use it unspoiled by any addition of fresh water , and in using this remedy prefer that an emetic should precede the draught . Then also they mix with the water vinegar or wine .

It is also however made in Crete without fresh water by letting the sea flow into the pools , and around Egypt by the sea itself , which penetrates the soil , soaked as I believe it is , by the Nile . Salt is also made by pouring water from wells into salt pools . At Babylon the first condensation solidifies into a liquid bitumen like oil , which is also used in lamps . When this is taken away , salt is underneath . In Cappadocia too they bring water into salt pools from wells and a spring . In Chaonia there is a spring , from which they boil water , and on cooling obtain a salt that is insipid and not white .

Each one dries up for periods of twelve , occasionally of twenty days , without the slightest trace of water , although there is a copious spring near them that never dries up .
On the other hand , in the African lake Apuscidamus everything floats and nothing sinks ; similarly in the Sicilian spring Phinthia , as Apion tells us , and among the Medes in the lake and well of Saturn . Again , the source of the river Limyra often crosses to neighbouring districts , indicating some portent , and a wonderful thing is that the fish cross with it . The inhabitants seek responses from them , offering food . To give a favourable answer the fish snap it up ; but for an unfavourable one , they knock it away with their tails .

It is dried out of the Tarentine lake by summer sun , when the whole pool turns into salt , although it is always shallow , never exceeding knee height , likewise in Sicily from a lake , called Cocanicus , and from another near Gela . Of these the edges only dry up ; in Phrygia , Cappadocia , and at Aspendus , the evaporation is wider , in fact right to the centre . There is yet another wonderful thing about it : the same amount is restored during the night as is taken away during the day .

Dislocated limbs of both man and quadrupeds are very easily reset by swimming in any kind of water . Travellers too are sometimes afraid lest unknown water should endanger their health . A precaution against this danger is to drink the suspected water cold immediately on leaving the bath . SOL An application of moss that has grown in water is good for gout , and mixed with oil for painful and swollen ankles .

It has been condemned now for many years a as having all the faults of wine with none of its advantages . SOL Because those at sea often suffer from the failure of fresh water , I shall describe ways meeting this difficulty . If spread around a ship , fleeces become moist by absorption of evaporated sea water , and from them can be squeezed water which is fresh . Again , hollow wax balls , let down into the sea in nets , or empty vessels with their mouth sealed , collect fresh water inside . But on land sea water is made fresh by filtering through clay . Dislocated limbs of both man and quadrupeds are very easily reset by swimming in any kind of water .

Salt and soda , when heated with sulphur , turn to stone . SOL Of the kinds of sponges I have spoken when describing the nature of marine creatures . Certain authorities classify them thus : some sponges , the males , have little holes , and are more compact and very absorbent ; they are also dyed for the luxurious , sometimes even with purple ; others , the females , have larger and uninterrupted holes ; others , harder than the males , called tragi , have very small holes that are very close together .

Boiled down too with leek , and burnt to make a dentifrice , it restores the colour of blackening teeth . Insects and nits on the head it kills if applied in oil with Samian earth . Dissolved in wine it is poured into purulent ears ; wax in the same organ it eats away in vinegar ; noises and singing it stops if added dry .

Sufferers from jaundice are helped by rubbing with salt , oil , and vinegar before a fire until they sweat ; this relieves the itching caused by this disease . Oil should be used in cases of fatigue . Many have treated dropsy too with salt , rubbed with salt and oil hot feverish patients , stayed a chronic cough by licking it , injected salt enemas into sufferers from sciatica , applied it to swollen or festering ulcers , and treated crocodile bites by salt and vinegar in lint cloths , taking care first to flog ' the sores with them . Salt is taken in oxymel for poisoning by poppy-juice , with flour and honey it is applied to dislocations , and also to tumours .

Therefore , Heaven knows , a civilized life is impossible without salt , and so necessary is this basic substance that its name is applied metaphorically even to intense mental pleasures . We call them sales ( wit ) ; all the humour of life , its supreme joyousness , and relaxation after toil , are expressed by this word more than by any other . It has a place in magistracies also and on service abroad , from which comes the term ' salary ' ( salt money ) ; it had great importance among the men of old , as is clear from the name of the Salarian Way , since by it , according to agreement , salt was imported to the Sabines .
The colour too of water changes , for example at Babylon a lake in summer has red water for eleven days , and the Borysthenes at fixed intervals flows with a blue colour , although of all waters it is the thinnest , and for that reason flows above the Hypanis .

All salt is made sweet by rainwater , more agreeable , however , by dew , but plentiful by gusts of north wind . It does not form under a south wind . Flower of salt forms only with north winds . Tragasaean salt and Acanthian , so named after towns , neither crackles nor sputters in a fire , nor does froth of any salt , or scrapings , or powder . Salt of Agrigentum submits to fire and sputters in water .
The last two are useful for the eyes . The salt imported from Cappadocia in little bricks is said to impart a gloss to the skin . But the salt I have said comes from Citium a smoothes the skin better , and so after childbirth it is applied with melanthium to the abdomen .

The colour too of salt varies : blushing red at Memphis , tawny red near the Oxus , purple at Centuripae , it is of such brightness near Gela ( also in Sicily ) that it reflects an image .

For allex both cures itch in sheep , being poured into an incision in the skin , and is a good antidote for the bites of dog or sea draco ; it is applied on pieces of lint . By garum too are fresh burns healed , if it is poured over them without mentioning garum . It is also good for dog-bites and especially those of the crocodile , and for spreading or foul ulcers .
The people of Forum Julii call lupus ( wolf ) the fish from which they make garum . Then allex became a luxury , and its various kinds have come to be innumerable ; garum for instance has been blended to the colour of old honey wine , and to a taste so pleasant that it can be drunk . But another kind of garum is devoted to superstitious sex-abstinence and Jewish rites , and is made from fish without scales .

For ulcers too or pains in mouth or ears it is wonderfully good .

In medicine soda warms , alleviates , stings , braces , dries , and clears away ulcers , and is useful for conditions where there must be withdrawal , dispersal , and gentle stinging and alleviation , as with pimples and blisters . Some for this purpose set it on fire and put it out with a dry wine , and use it so prepared and ground in the bath without oil .
The tests of soda are that it should be very fine and as spongy and full of holes as possible . In Egypt it is adulterated with lime , which is detected by the taste ; for pure soda melts at once , but adulterated soda stings because of the lime , and gives out a strong odour . It is burnt in an earthen jar with a lid , lest it should crackle out ; otherwise soda does not crackle in fire ; it produces nothing and nourishes nothing , whereas in salt-pits grow plants , and in the sea so many animals and so much seaweed . But that the pungency of soda is greater is shown not only by this evidence but also by the fact that soda-beds at once consume shoes , but are otherwise healthful and good for clearness of vision . In the soda-beds nobody has ophthalmia ; sores brought there heal very quickly , but those that form there heal slowly . Soda and oil also make to sweat those who are rubbed with the mixture , which softens the flesh . They use Chalestran soda for bread instead of salt , Egyptian soda for radishes ; it makes them more tender , but meats white and inferior and vegetables greener .

Some for this purpose set it on fire and put it out with a dry wine , and use it so prepared and ground in the bath without oil . Excessive sweats are checked by soda with dried iris and the addition of green oil ; it also improves scars on the eyes and roughness of the lids if applied with fig , or boiled down to one half in raisin wine , a preparation too which is used for white ulcers and inflamed swellings on the eyes .

SOL To come now to the classes of water : some waters are good for sinews or feet , or for sciatica ; others for dislocations or fractures ; they purge the bowels ; heal wounds ; are specific for head , or for ears ; while the Ciceronian are so for the eyes . It is worth while recording that there is a country seat on the coast as you go from Lake Avernus to Puteoli , with a famous portico and grove , which lvi . Cicero , copying Athens , called Academia . There he wrote the volumes called Academica , and in it he also erected memorials to himself , as though indeed he had not done so throughout the whole world . In the front part of this estate , when the owner was Antistius Vetus , a short time after Cicero 's demise there burst out hot springs , very beneficial for eye complaints , which have been made famous by a poem of Laurea Tullus , who was one of Cicero 's freedmen . From it we at once realize that even his servants drew inspiration from that mighty genius . For I will quote the actual poem , which deserves to be read , not only on this site , but everywhere . SOL ' O famous champion of our Latin tongue , where grows with a fairer green the grove you bade rise , and the villa , honoured by the name of Academe , Vetus keeps in repair under a more careful tendance , here are also to be seen waters not revealed before , which with drops infused relieve wearied eyes .

SOL The water of Lake Alphins removes psoriasis , Varro tells us , adding that Titius , an ex-praetor , as a result of this complaint had a face like that of a marble statue . The Cydnus , a river of Cilicia , cures gout , as appears from a letter of Cassius of Parma to M . Antonius . On the other hand , it is the fault of the water in Troezen that everyone there suffers from diseases of the feet . The Tungri , a state of Gaul , has a remarkable spring that sparkles with innumerable bubbles , with a taste of iron rust , which yet cannot be detected until the water has been drunk . It is a purgative , and cures tertian agues and stone in the bladder . This water also , if fire is brought near it , becomes turbid , and finally turns red .

They rightly condemn stagnant and sluggish waters , holding that running water is more beneficial , as it is made finer and more healthy by the mere agitation of the current . For this reason I am surprised that some physicians recommend highly water from cisterns . But these physicians put forward a reason ; the lightest water , they say , is rainwater , seeing that it has been able to rise and to be suspended in the atmosphere . Therefore they also prefer snow and ice even more than snow , as though its texture were rarefied to the utmost ; for , they say , snow and ice are lighter than water , and ice much lighter . To refute this view is a matter that is important to all men .

That snow indeed and ice should be considered the finest form of that element makes me wonder , when I have before me the evidence of hailstones , to drink the water of which it is agreed is most unwholesome .

Moreover we are told that if drawn in vessels [ without being weighed , or without being warmed by the hand ] and placed on the ground , the better water becomes warm . From what source then shall we obtain the most commendable water ? From wells surely , as I see they are generally used in towns , but they should be those the water of which by frequent withdrawals is kept in constant motion , and those where due thinness is obtained by filtering through the earth . For wholesomeness so much suffices ; for coolness both shade is necessary and that the well should be open to the air . One point above all must be observed — and this is also important for a continuous flow — well water should issue from the bottom , not the sides .

This shows that it is the character of the soil that produces soda , since it has been discovered that , when it ceases , neither sunshine is of any help at all nor yet rain . Another wonderful thing about the lake is that although the spring is always bubbling up it neither gets larger nor overflows . But if , on those days on which soda forms , has been rain , it makes the soda more salty , while north winds on those days , by stirring up the mud too vigorously , makes it inferior .

SOL Springs arise often when woods have been cut down , being used up before as sustenance for the trees ; this happened when Cassander was besieging the Gauls after the woods on Mount Haemus had been felled by them to make a rampart . Often indeed devastating torrents unite when from hills has been cut away the wood that used to hold the rains and absorbs them . It also improves the water supply for the earth to he dug and tilled , and for the hard surface crust to be broken up . It is at any rate reported that in Crete , when a town called Arcadia had been stormed , the many springs and rivers of that region went dry , and six years afterwards , when the town was rebuilt , they reappeared , as each piece of land came under cultivation . Earthquakes too make water break out or swallow it up , for example , as is well known , around Pheneus in Arcadia this has happened five times .

But the clearest proof of its importance lies in the fact that no sacrifice is carried out without the mola salsa ( salted meal ) . SOL Salt-pools have reached their highest degree of purity in what may be called embers of salt , which is the lightest and whitest of its kind . ' Flower of salt ' is also a name given to an entirely different thing , with a moister nature and a saffron or red colour , a kind of salt rust ; it has an unpleasant smell , like that of garum , and is different from salt , not only from foam salt . Egypt discovered it , and it appears to be brought down by the Nile . It also however floats on the surface of certain springs . The best kind of it yields a sort of oily fat , for there is , surprising as it may seem , a fat even in salt . It is adulterated too and coloured by red ochre , or usually by ground crockery ; this sham is detected by water , which washes out the artificial colour , while the genuine is only removed by oil , and perfumers use it very commonly because of its colour . In vessels the whiteness is seen on the surface , but the inner part , as I have said , is moister . The nature of flower of salt is acrid , heating , bad for the stomach , sudorific , aperient when taken in wine and water , and useful for anodynes and detergents .

SOL Everywhere in many lands gush forth beneficent waters , here cold , there hot , there both , as among the Tarbelli , an Aquitanian tribe , and in the Pyrenees , with only a short distance separating the two , in some places tepid and lukewarm , promising relief to the sick and bursting forth to help only men of all the animals . Water adds to the number of the gods by its various names , and founds cities , such as Puteoli in Campania , Statiellae in Liguria , and Sextiae in the province of Narbonensis . Nowhere however is water more bountiful than in the Bay of Baiae , or with more variety of relief : some has the virtue of sulphur , some of alum , some of salt , some of soda , some of bitumen , some are even acid and salt in combination ; of some the mere steam is beneficial , of which the power a is so great that it heats baths and even makes cold water boil in the tubs .
Water swallows up the land , destroys flames , climbs aloft claiming the sovereignty even of the sky , and by a blanket of clouds chokes the life-giving spirit , so forcing out thunderbolts , the world waging civil war with itself . What can be more wonderful than water seated in the sky ? But as though it were a little thing to reach this great height , water sucks up thither with itself shoals of fish , and often even stones , carrying up aloft a weight other than its own . This element also falls again to become the source of all things that spring from the earth .

Certain lands become drier in rainy weather , as the region of Narnia ; Marcus Cicero included this in his Marvels , saying that drought brings mud , and rain dust . SOL All water is sweeter in winter , in summer less so , in autumn least , and less during droughts . The taste of rivers is usually variable , owing to the great difference in river beds . For waters vary with the land over which they flow , and with the juices of the plants they wash . Therefore the same rivers are found in some parts to be unwholesome . Tributaries too alter the flavour of a river , as do those of the Borysthenes , and being absorbed are diluted .

SOL I wonder that Homer made no mention of hot springs , and that though he frequently speaks of hot baths , the reason being that modern hydropathie treatment was not then a part of medicine . Sulphur waters , however , are good for the sinews , alum waters for paralysis and similar cases of collapse , waters containing bitumen and soda , such as that of Cutilia , are good for drinking and as a purge . Many people make a matter of boasting the great number of hours they can endure the heat of these sulphur waters — a very injurious practice , for one should remain in them a little longer than in the bath , afterwards rinse in cool , fresh water , and not go away without a rubbing with oil . The common people find these details irksome , and so there is no greater risk to health than this treatment , because an overpowering smell goes to the head , which sweats and is seized with chill , while the rest of the body is immersed .

The ash of the African sponge , swallowed with the juice of cut-leek , is good for spitting of blood ; for other complaints it should be taken in cold water . This ash also , applied to the forehead with oil or vinegar , cures tertian agues . African sponges are specific with vinegar and water for reducing swellings , and the ash of all sponges burnt with pitch arrest haemorrhage from wounds ; for this purpose some burn with pitch only sponges of loose texture . For eye remedies sponges are burnt in an unbaked earthenware pot , this ash being very efficacious indeed for roughness or excrescences of the eyelids , and for any complaint in the region of the eyes that needs a remedy detergent , astringent , or expletive , but for this treatment it is better to rinse the ash . They also furnish a substitute for scrapers and towels when the body is diseased . Sponges protect also efficiently the head against the sun . In their ignorance physicians have reduced sponges to two classes : the African , which are firmer and harder , and the Ithodian , which are softer for fomentations . Today however a very soft sponges are found around the walls of Antiphellus .
